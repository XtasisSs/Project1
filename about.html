                  Doughnut Delights was started in 1971 by Melvin Furballski, an
                  immigrant baker from the far east coast of Poland. Known far
                  and wide for his delicate pastries, Melvin fled his homeland
                  in search of a better life for his family. In 1970 he landed
                  in New York City and by chance he found an open seat on a bus
                  heading west. When an unexpected mechanical failure forced a
                  three day delay in Champaign, Illinois, Furballski saw the
                  need for a doughnut shop, so he decided to stay and make a new
                  life for himself in Urbana, Illinois. With only one hundred
                  dollars to his name, he found an abandoned breadshop and
                  within two days he had one of a kind doughnuts flying off the
                  racks faster than he could bake them and things have never
                  slowed down.

                    Now you can find that same great doughnut recipe plus dozens
                    more still being made with the same love and care as when
                    Doughnut Delights first opened. A bakery fire in the
                    mid-1980s destroyed many of the shop's records...but NOT THE
                    RECIPES. While many people might have viewed the fire as an
                    excuse to quit, Melvin instead used it as an opportunity to
                    reconfigure the interior design, allowing him to add the
                    coffee roastery section as well. So when you visit, be
                    prepared for the inviting mix of aromas from fresh-roasted
                    coffee beans and fresh-baked donuts: It's the closest thing
                    to "Breakfast Heaven" anywhere in the C-U area!
